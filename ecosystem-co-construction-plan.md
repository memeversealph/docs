# Ecosystem Co-construction Plan

MemeVerse Infinity is dedicated to building and developing an open, innovative, and decentralized ecosystem together with the community. To this end, we have launched the Ecosystem Co-construction Plan, inviting more developers, project teams, creators, and community members to participate, promoting the expansion and diversification of the ecosystem.

## Core Components of the Co-construction;

* **Funding Support**: Provide seed funding and token support for outstanding projects to help them launch and grow.
* **Community Incentives:** Encourage community members to participate in ecosystem co-construction through code contributions, content creation, community management, etc., with contributors earning MVT rewards.
* &#x20;**Partnership Program**: Invite external projects and partners to participate, jointly exploring cross-chain collaborations, DeFi integrations, and other innovative directions.
* **Education and Training**: Offer training on blockchain technology, development tools, and DAO governance to enhance community membersâ€™ knowledge and skills, supporting the long-term development of the ecosystem.

Through this co-construction plan, MemeVerse Infinity aims to build a vibrant and innovative ecosystem that attracts more developers and users, jointly promoting a decentralized future.
